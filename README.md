# Advanced Challenge: GRID with Animations - Rocketseat Explorer :rocket:

This challenge is a combination of challenges 7 and 8 available in the course, in Stage 03 - Advancing in HTML and CSS.

In it we must create a page using the concepts of responsiveness and animation together with the alignment of the GRID type. Part 7 is about creating the mobile page, while part 8 is adding responsiveness for larger devices. The page in desktop format is seen in the image below:
